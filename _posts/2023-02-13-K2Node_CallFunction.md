title: Make UFUNCTIONs fancier, and fast with K2Node_CallFunction
---

If you're new to K2Nodes, I'd suggest you check out my post [Introduction to K2Node](https://olssondev.github.io/2023-02-13-K2Nodes/) first.

Let's say you have a UFUNCTION you want to improve the UX on or make fancier in some way, but don't have the time or energy to set up a K2Node from scratch.

That's where **K2Node_CallFunction** comes in and saves the day with minimal setup!

**In Progress**
