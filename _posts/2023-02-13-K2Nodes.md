title: The mysteries of custom Blueprint nodes
tags: [test]
---

During the development of my custom quest editor, Adventure, I've gotten very comfortable with creating custom nodes for both Blueprint and custom graphs. But this blog post will cover custom **Blueprint nodes**, since a custom graph node is a whole different story.

## K2Node and what are they?

Kismet was the first visual scripting language in the engine. It was first introduced with Unreal Engine 3, then Kismet 2 came along and got renamed Blueprint, which is what we have today. So that is why you'll see K2 (Kismet 2) in some places of the engine. 

This naturally brings us to K2Node (Kismet 2 Node), the parent class for all nodes used for Blueprint graphs. Most you see in the graph nodes inherit from **UK2Node_CallFunction**.

Making custom K2Nodes enables the developer to have complete control of the nodes rather than be limited to UFUNCTION specifiers, but 99% of the time, they are enough.

## K2Node and what are they?

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
